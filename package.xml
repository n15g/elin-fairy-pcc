        I love that Elin lets you play as a fairy character, but was disappointed that the base
        game doesn't really offer any way to visually differentiate a fairy character from the other
        races.

        This mod adds new portraits and sprites for fairy characters that are much smaller than the default sprites,
        including
        a bunch of pretty fairy wings. The smaller stature of the PCC can cause some visual glitches, noted below, but
        for the
        most part it works well.

        Fairy portraits are all full-body to reflect the smaller stature of the fae.
